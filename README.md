#### LLM Recruiter Assistant
**LLM-powered AI Agent for Scoring LinkedIn Profiles Based on Job Fit**
This project builds a recruitment assistant that scrapes LinkedIn profiles, evaluates candidate fit based on a job description, and generates personalized outreach messages using LLMs. It helps automate the early-stage sourcing and triage process for tech hiring.
## Features
•	Scrapes public LinkedIn profiles using `undetected_chromedriver`
•	Calculates a custom Fit Score based on: Education, Work trajectory, Company prestige, Skills, Location
•	Uses LLMs (via OpenAI) to draft personalized outreach messages
•	JSON-based architecture for easy logging and extension
## How It Works
1.	 Input a job description and a list of LinkedIn profile URLs.
2.	 The agent scrapes and parses key candidate data.
3.	 Each profile is scored based on a weighted rubric.
4.	 A personalized message is generated for each candidate.
